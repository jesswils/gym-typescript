I used [UnSplash](https://unsplash.com/) for the images and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/en_gb/) to edit them.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, cd into `gym-typescript` (I need help with naming things), install and run the development server with:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.
