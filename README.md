# Gym SPA 

Based on the tutorial by Ed Roh: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2NNxr3WPDo

This is a React website bootstrapped with Vite, based off a [Figma Banking UI](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1282341166777547361)

## Getting Started
  cd vite-project
  npm install
  npm run dev

Clone the repository, cd into `gym-typescript` (I need help with naming things), install and run the development server with:

```
npm install
and 
npm run dev
```

> I used [UnSplash](https://unsplash.com/) to find the images and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/en_gb/) to edit them.

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.
